:description: An ever so brief explanation of why Verisimilitude enhances your OpenID Connect testing process.

== Why?
Why not.

== No seriously, why.
User authentication often causes significant vexation during the testing process, which is only compounded by the use of external user authentication such as OAuth (eg _sign in with Google/Facebook_).

*Firstly*, automating these systems can be difficult-to-impossible, especially if the authentication service is completely external. While this can be mitigated through the use of a local, containerized OAuth provider during development (such as the splendid [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/)), these still require substantial setup and comprise a fairly heavy dependency to include during development and CI/CD.

*Secondly*, authentication complicates the endowment of tests with the virtues of being Atomic, Rapid and Repeatable. Which is a shame, as fast, reliable tests bring much joy and delivery speed to all the ~~children~~ testers and developers. How, you may ask? Well, mocking authentication means you're no longer testing reality. Contrariwise, _not_ mocking authentication typically compels you to either retain a login session from the first test ran (introducing unwanted dependencies) or log in before _every_ test (introducing needless delay).

Verisimilitude takes the position that tests which aren't specifically login tests have their own concerns. As such, it provides an in-memory OAuth server with _just enough_ features to complete an OICD authentication flow, during which it blithely ignores most of the *MUST*s, *SHOULD*s and *WILL*s of the specification before returning you details for a completely fanciful user.
