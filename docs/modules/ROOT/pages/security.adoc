== There isn't any.

WARNING: Do not use Verisimilitude as an identity provider in production _or_ in any situation requiring real authentication.

Verisimilitude is designed to function as an OpenID Identity Connect provider in most functional respects, but critically, _not in terms of actually identifying users_. Indeed, that is the very quintessence of the beast!

When contacted with a well-formed request, Verisimilitude will act as though it has already solicited identifying information from a user and authenticated them.
