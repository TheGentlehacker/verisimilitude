= Verisimilitude
---
Verisimilitude is your trusted confidant, an OIDC assistant making tests faster, easier & more efficacious via an in-memory implementation of an OpenID Provider which supports the OpenID Connect Authorization Code Flow. Poorly.

== What is it good for?
Such an excellent question! Verisimilitude is suitable for an exciting range of functions, including:
* Test Acceleration
* OIDC Development Support
* ...

== What is it not good for?
Oh heavens, most everything. I shouldn't rely on it for any of the following:
* Actual user authentication
* Testing OAuth clients
* Critical infrastructure protection
* Emotional Support
* Paying back that money it owes, it's very sorry, could it beg your indulgence just a little longer?
